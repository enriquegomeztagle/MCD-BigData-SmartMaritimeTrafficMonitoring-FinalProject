\section{Resumen ejecutivo}
\subsection{Introducción} % REVISIÓN: GUILLÉN 

El tráfico marítimo global genera millones de registros de posicionamiento a través del Sistema de Identificación Automática (AIS), que transmite automáticamente la identidad, posición, velocidad y otros datos de los buques. Originalmente implementado para mejorar la seguridad de la navegación, hoy es crucial para la gestión del tráfico marítimo, la conciencia del entorno y operaciones de búsqueda y rescate.

Este proyecto propone aprovechar Big Data y aprendizaje automático (ML) para analizar una base de datos masiva de mensajes AIS y ofrecer una solución innovadora a la pregunta: \textbf{¿Cómo detectar y entender comportamientos anómalos en el tráfico marítimo para mejorar la seguridad y la eficiencia?}

Responder esta pregunta implica analizar patrones normales de navegación y descubrir desviaciones significativas. En esencia:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{¿Qué estamos haciendo?} Diseñamos un sistema de análisis que procesa grandes volúmenes de datos AIS para identificar anomalías en el comportamiento de los buques (posiciones fuera de lugar, velocidades inusuales, maniobras erráticas, etc.) y extraer patrones útiles sobre la operación de diferentes tipos de embarcaciones.
    \item \textbf{¿Para qué lo hacemos?} Para mejorar la seguridad marítima, la gestión del tráfico y la toma de decisiones, ofreciendo alertas tempranas de potenciales riesgos (colisiones, actividades ilícitas o fallos) y conocimiento profundo a autoridades y empresas navieras.
    \item \textbf{¿Cómo lo hacemos?} Empleando herramientas de Big Data de la Suite de Google Cloud (Storage + DataProc + BigQuery) para procesar datos geoespaciales masivos en en poco tiempo, complementado con modelos de ML que aprenden patrones habituales y detectan comportamientos que se apartan de lo normal.
    \item \textbf{¿A quién beneficia?} A organismos de seguridad marítima (marinas, guardacostas), a empresas navieras optimizando rutas y monitoreo de flotas, a aseguradoras evaluando riesgos operativos e incluso a investigadores del medio marino en estudios ecológicos.
\end{itemize}

Finalmente, los resultados se integraron en un \textit{dashboard} interactivo con visualizaciones (mapas geográficos, gráficos de tendencias y rankings) que facilitan la interpretación y la toma de decisiones.

\section{Visión general del desarrollo} 
\subsection{Solución Actual / visión general} % REVISIÓN: GUILLÉN FALTA DOCUMENTAR ML 

La solución actual se implementa de extremo a extremo sobre la nube de Google Cloud. El flujo completo es el siguiente:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Una máquina virtual en Google Compute Engine se encarga de \textbf{scrapear los datos AIS} y cargarlos en Google Cloud Storage. 
    \item En Cloud Storage se organizan dos capas diferenciadas: \textit{raw} y \textit{curated}, con prefijos de carpeta y particiones por mes (\texttt{YYYY-MM=}).
    \item Un clúster de Google Cloud DataProc ejecuta dos jobs:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Job \textbf{raw}: descomprime los archivos obtenidos y organiza los datos en particiones por año y mes, y finalmente los guarda en formato Parquet en Google Cloud Storage.
        \item Job \textbf{curated}: lee la capa cruda, aplica transformaciones iniciales y genera la capa refinada lista para análisis.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Una Cloud Function crea el \textbf{dataset y la tabla en BigQuery}, cargando la información desde la capa curated.
    \item En BigQuery se centraliza la explotación de datos mediante consultas SQL optimizadas, generando los datasets finales que alimentan las visualizaciones.
    \item El \textbf{dashboard de Streamlit}, desplegado en la misma VM, consume los resultados de BigQuery y presenta mapas, gráficos de tendencias y rankings de manera interactiva.
\end{itemize}

Toda la solución se ejecuta en la región \texttt{us-central1}. Para evitar duplicados en el flujo, se utiliza la clave compuesta \textbf{MMSI + timestamp}.
